# Datomic/Sinatra Wiki

This is a simple wiki built to demonstrate using Datomic from Ruby.

## Usage

1. Download this repository.
2. Go to the repository directory.
3. Make sure you have Datomic, Ruby and Bundler installed.
4. Run `bundle` (or however you like to run Bundler.)
5. Start a Datomic REST client with the following parameters: `$DATOMIC_HOME/bin/rest 9000 wiki`
6. Start the application by running: `bundle exec ./wiki.rb`
7. Go to http://localhost:4567 and start playing around! It is not currently very discoverable, but this will change in the future.
